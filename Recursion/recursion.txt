Recursion — concise definition and examples

Definition: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Each recursive call should reduce the problem size and must include a base case that stops further recursion.

Key parts:

Base case: a simple condition that returns a result without a recursive call (prevents infinite recursion).
Recursive case: the part where the function calls itself on a smaller/simpler input.
Termination: every recursive path must eventually reach a base case.
